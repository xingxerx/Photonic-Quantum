# Implementation Plan: Prism Collapse

**Feature Branch**: `001-prism-collapse-build`
**Spec File**: `specs/001-prism-collapse-build/spec.md`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft

## Architecture Overview
- **Language/Framework**: C# with WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
- **Pattern**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **UI**: Canvas for lattice, Storyboards for animation
- **Physics**: Custom classes for Photon, Gate, Wavefunction
- **Data**: In-memory for levels and state
- **Networking**: PvP via sockets (future phase)
- **Deployment**: Standalone .exe

## Key Components
- **Model**: Photon, Gate (Splitter, Shifter, Entangler, Polarizer), LatticeGrid, Wavefunction, ScoreSystem, CoherenceReservoir
- **View**: Animated Canvas, Holographic overlays, Particle effects
- **ViewModel**: Game state, Commands, Data binding

## Animation & Visuals
- Use DoubleAnimation for movement, ColorAnimation for state changes
- Particle effects for decoherence, collapse, and power-ups
- Ribbons for probability, glowing threads for entanglement
- Holographic UI: coherence bar, quantum meters

## Game Loop
1. **Setup**: Drag-drop gates, select photon streams
2. **Propagation**: Animate lattice, update quantum states
3. **Collapse**: Handle measurement, scoring, and effects
4. **PvP**: (Future) Send/defend decoherence pulses

## Development Phases
1. Core classes and lattice logic
2. Propagation and quantum simulation
3. Animation system
4. Game loop and UI
5. Scoring, PvP basics
6. Testing and polish

## Constraints
- No external libraries beyond .NET/WPF
- Modular, well-documented code
- Prioritize smooth animation and educational clarity

## Risks & Open Questions
- [ ] PvP networking details (protocol, sync)
- [ ] Accessibility features (to be defined)
- [ ] Performance for large lattices

## Next Steps
- Finalize class diagrams
- Start with Model and ViewModel scaffolding
- Build minimal working lattice and photon propagation
