## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Players launch photons into a dynamic lattice, manipulate gates to create quantum effects, and trigger measurement collapse to maximize score before decoherence drains the coherence reservoir.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the game is started, **When** the player launches photons and manipulates gates, **Then** the lattice evolves with real-time quantum/photonic effects and scoring updates.
2. **Given** a PvP match, **When** an opponent sends decoherence pulses, **Then** the player can defend with shields and see visual feedback.
3. **Given** a level with specific objectives, **When** the player collapses the quantum state, **Then** rewards are based on coherence, entanglement, and timing.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the coherence reservoir reaches zero? (Game over, lattice fades out)
- How does the system handle simultaneous photon launches? (All propagate, superpositions handled)
- What if a player tries to measure at an invalid node? (Show error, no collapse)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow players to launch photons with selectable color, phase, and polarization.
- **FR-002**: System MUST simulate real-time propagation through a lattice with photonic and quantum effects (interference, diffraction, superposition, entanglement).
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable placement and manipulation of gates (splitters, shifters, entanglers, polarizers).
- **FR-004**: System MUST animate probability ribbons, interference, and collapse events with particle effects.
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement a scoring system based on coherence, entanglement, and collapse efficiency.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide PvP mode with decoherence attacks and defenses.
- **FR-007**: System MUST include educational tooltips explaining physics concepts.
- **FR-008**: System MUST support multiple levels with increasing complexity.
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle game over when coherence reservoir is depleted.
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide accessibility options [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which accessibility features are required?]

### Key Entities
- **Photon**: Represents a quantum of light; attributes: color, phase, polarization, entanglement state.
- **LatticeNode**: A point in the lattice; attributes: position, connected gates, photon occupancy.
- **QuantumGate**: Devices that alter photon state; subtypes: Splitter, Shifter, Entangler, Polarizer.
- **Wavefunction**: Represents the quantum state vector for all photons in the lattice.
- **CoherenceReservoir**: Tracks available coherence; depletes with decoherence, refills on successful collapses.
- **ScoreSystem**: Calculates and tracks player score based on game events.
