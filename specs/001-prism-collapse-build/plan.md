# Implementation Plan: Prism Collapse 3D

**Feature Branch**: `001-prism-collapse-build`
**Spec File**: `specs/001-prism-collapse-build/spec.md`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft

## Architecture Overview
- **Language/Framework**: C# with WPF 3D (or Unity for full 3D support)
- **Pattern**: MVVM (if WPF) or ECS (if Unity)
- **UI**: 3D Canvas/Viewport for lattice, Storyboards/Animation system for effects
- **Physics**: Custom classes for Photon, Gate, Wavefunction, plus 3D movement and collision
- **Data**: In-memory for levels and state
- **Networking**: PvP via sockets (future phase)
- **Deployment**: Standalone .exe

## Key Components
- **Model**: Photon, Gate (Splitter, Shifter, Entangler, Polarizer), LatticeGrid3D, Wavefunction, ScoreSystem, CoherenceReservoir
- **View**: Animated 3D Canvas/Viewport, Holographic overlays, Particle effects
- **ViewModel**: Game state, Commands, Data binding

## Animation & Visuals
- Use 3D transforms and animations for movement, ColorAnimation for state changes
- Particle effects for decoherence, collapse, and power-ups
- Ribbons for probability, glowing threads for entanglement
- Holographic UI: coherence bar, quantum meters

## Game Loop
1. **Setup**: Drag-drop gates, select photon streams
2. **Propagation**: Animate lattice, update quantum states, handle 3D movement and collision
3. **Collapse**: Handle measurement, scoring, and effects
4. **PvP**: (Future) Send/defend decoherence pulses

## Development Phases
1. Core classes and lattice logic (3D)
2. Propagation, movement, collision, and quantum simulation
3. Animation system (3D)
4. Game loop and UI
5. Scoring, PvP basics
6. Testing and polish

## Constraints
- No external libraries beyond .NET/WPF or Unity
- Modular, well-documented code
- Prioritize smooth animation and educational clarity

## Risks & Open Questions
- [ ] PvP networking details (protocol, sync)
- [ ] Accessibility features (to be defined)
- [ ] Performance for large 3D lattices
- [ ] WPF 3D vs Unity for full 3D support

## Next Steps
- Finalize class diagrams for 3D
- Start with Model and ViewModel scaffolding
- Build minimal working 3D lattice and photon propagation
