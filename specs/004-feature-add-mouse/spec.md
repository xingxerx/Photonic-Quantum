# Feature Specification: Mouse/Keyboard Support & AI Integration

**Feature Branch**: `004-feature-add-mouse`
**Created**: September 20, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add Mouse and keyboard support to the project as well as the important stuff that fcan be used in this project from thisrepo https://github.com/xingxerx/Ai.git"

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A user interacts with the simulation/game using both mouse and keyboard. The user can select, move, and manipulate objects in the 3D/4D scene using these input methods. The project is enhanced with AI-driven features or utilities sourced from the referenced AI repository, improving interactivity, automation, or intelligence in the simulation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the simulation is running, **When** the user clicks or drags with the mouse, **Then** the corresponding object is selected, held, or moved as expected.
2. **Given** the simulation is running, **When** the user presses a supported keyboard key, **Then** the system responds (e.g., toggles object state, moves camera, triggers AI action).
3. **Given** the AI features are integrated, **When** the user or system triggers an AI-driven function, **Then** the simulation/game responds with enhanced or automated behavior.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if multiple input events (mouse/keyboard) occur simultaneously?
- How does the system handle unsupported keys or mouse actions?
- What if the AI integration fails or is unavailable?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to select, hold, and move objects using the mouse.
- **FR-002**: System MUST support keyboard shortcuts for key actions (e.g., object manipulation, camera control, toggling features).
- **FR-003**: System MUST integrate relevant AI-driven features/utilities from https://github.com/xingxerx/Ai.git to enhance simulation/game interactivity or automation.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear feedback for all mouse and keyboard actions.
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle simultaneous or conflicting input events gracefully.
- **FR-006**: System MUST degrade gracefully if AI features are unavailable or fail to load.
- **FR-007**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which specific AI features/utilities from the referenced repo are most important to integrate?]
- **FR-008**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the expected keyboard shortcuts and their mappings?]

### Key Entities
- **User Input Event**: Represents a mouse or keyboard action, with type, target, and timestamp.
- **Scene Object**: Any interactive object in the simulation that can be selected, held, or manipulated.
- **AI Feature/Utility**: A capability imported from the external AI repo, enhancing simulation/game logic or automation.
