
# Feature Specification: Photonic Quantum Animation (PQA)

## Overview

Develop PQA, a C# Unity-based application for visualizing photonic quantum computing processes. The tool animates quantum states (qubits, entanglement, gates) using photonic circuits, targeting educational use with interactive simulations and exportable animations. The workflow is driven by spec-kit for SDD (spec-driven development).

## Motivation

- Make quantum computing concepts accessible and visual for students and researchers.
- Provide hands-on, interactive learning with real-time feedback.
- Enable export of animations for teaching, presentations, and documentation.
- Demonstrate photonic approaches to quantum logic (light-based qubits, beam splitters, polarizations).

## User Scenarios

- A student builds a quantum circuit with drag-and-drop gates, visualizes state evolution, and exports an animation for a class project.
- An educator demonstrates entanglement and superposition using animated photons and interactive controls.
- A researcher validates quantum gate operations visually and compares results with Qiskit.
- A developer extends the tool by adding new gate types or export formats, using the SDD workflow.

## Functional Requirements

- Unity scenes for quantum gate animations (Hadamard, CNOT, phase gates).
- Simulate light-based qubits (photons, polarizations, beam splitters).
- Interactive UI panel for circuit building and real-time state visualization.
- Export animation output as GIF/MP4.
- Integrate spec-kit CLI for spec/plan/task/constitution/implement.
- All features must be accessible via Unity 2022.3 LTS, C# 11, and use fewer than 10 external packages (e.g., Unity.Mathematics).

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Modularity: Separate animation, quantum logic, and UI via Unity components.
- Accuracy: Quantum operations must follow standard models; validate with Qiskit (Python bridge if needed).
- Performance: 60 FPS animations; use LOD for complex circuits.
- Accessibility: Intuitive controls, tooltips, color-blind modes.
- SDD: Use spec-kit for all features; commit specs to Git.
- Licensing: MIT, credit quantum sources.

## Key Entities

- Qubit: C# class representing a quantum state vector.
- QuantumGate: Base class for gate operations (matrix multiplications).
- PhotonAnimator: Component for animating photon paths and interference.
- CircuitBuilder: UI logic for drag-and-drop circuit construction.
- ExportModule: Handles GIF/MP4 output.
- SpecKitWrapper: Editor script to invoke spec-kit CLI from Unity.

## Out of Scope

- Non-photonic quantum models (e.g., trapped ions, superconducting qubits).
- Hardware integration or real device execution.
- More than 10 external Unity packages.
- Mobile platform builds (focus on Windows/Mac/WebGL).

## Open Questions

- Which quantum gate set should be prioritized beyond Hadamard, CNOT, and phase gates?
- Preferred export settings (resolution, frame rate, animation length)?
- Should Qiskit validation be automated or manual?
- Any specific accessibility requirements (languages, input devices)?
